# Multiplication Two Array with One Dimensional
### Based on two arrays A1 and A2 having respectively 4 and 2 as a maximum size, write a C++ program to compute the “Schtroumpf” of these two arrays. To calculate the Schtroumpf, we have to multiply each element of the first array A1 by each element of the second array A2 and make the sum at each operation of multiplication.

Example:
<pre>
Array A1: 4-8-7-12
Array A2: 3-6
The Schtroumpf is equal to: 3*4 + 3*8 + 3*7 + 3*12 + 6*4 + 6*8 + 6*7 + 6*12 = 279
</pre>
